Week 6 Homework
WeatherPy
Using openweathermap.org an analysis was run of random cities in the world to gather the city name, latitude, longitude, max temp, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, country and date of analysis.

A variety of comparisons were shown to characherize the data.  One thing that was interesting was contrary to initial assumptions, the humidity of the random cities chosen did not get more humid as they became closer to the equator.  This might there is a good chance that the points chosen at random were not surrounded by water since there are several deserts located near the equator.  The cities in these areas would likely also not be any more humid than some northern cities that were chosen.

figures were saved in the Figure sub-folder with data showing the following:
* Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude


VacationPy
In this exercise the cities that were randomly chosen were displayed in a heatmap to show the humidity in each location

These locations were then filtered by favorable vacation conditions including humidity, cloudiness and max temperature. This resulted in 20 cities with that met the criterea specified.

A google maps search was performed to find hotels in these areas

These hotels found nearby the city latitudes and longitudes were displayed in a map displaying the hotel name, city and country.
